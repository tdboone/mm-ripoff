### L'il Vroom Vrooms

#### Q. What is this?

L'il Vroom Vrooms is a game inspired by Micro Machines for SNES.
It is a work in progress, but is reasonably fun even in its current state!

1. Have four Xbox360 controllers and four people to wield them
2. Be using Google Chrome
3. Go [here](https://zpchavez.github.io/lvv)
4. Click the game area for the optimal full screen experience

#### Q. What if I don't have Xbox360 controllers?

You can play two players on one keyboard using:

- Player1: ← ↑ → ↓ ENTER
- Player2: WASD SPACEBAR

It's better with 4 players though!

#### Q. Isn't this game kinda ugly-looking?

Yes.
